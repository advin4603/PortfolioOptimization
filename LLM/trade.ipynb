The current close price is significantly lower than the cost basis, resulting in a loss per share. This indicates that holding the shares is currently unprofitable.\\n2. The price has decreased by 1.86% from the opening price, suggesting a bearish trend for the day.\\n3. The trading volume is below average, which may indicate a lack of strong market interest or momentum.\\n\\nGiven these factors, it would be prudent to minimize losses by selling shares. Since I hold 24 shares, I will decide to sell all of them.\\n\\n### Final Decision:\\nDECISION: -24',\n",
